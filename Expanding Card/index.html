          <h3>Saber</h3>
          <p>
            Legendary King of Britain, and the King of Knights. Her childhood
            name was Altria, but she has been known as King Arthur since her
            coronation. At a time when chivalry was dying like a flower wilting
            away, she brought momentary peace and the last bit of prosperity to
            Britain with her sacred sword in hand. In history books Arthur is
            male, but in this world she is a woman in disguise.

          <h3>Archer - Emiya</h3>
          <p>
            As his origin is slightly different than other Heroic Spirits, you
            cannot call him an official Heroic Spirit. He is a Guardian, and
            serves as the defensive system for humanity's "collective
            unconsciousness." His very being is humanity's Counter Force. He is
            a faceless enforcer of justice chosen by the nameless.

          <h3>Lancer - Cú Chulainn</h3>
          <p>
            With a dislike of decorations and honor, this spearman prefers to
            listen to his instincts. If it's a job, he won't hesitate to kill
            even an ordinary citizen. Though he can be merciless outside of the
            job, he's honorable and takes care of others.
